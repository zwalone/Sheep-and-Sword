### Project description
**Sheep and Sword** is a 2D platformer, adventure game full of monsters that need to be killed. 
There are two versions of this game: one for PC and one for Android. It was **written with C# and Unity** 
and consists of five levels. The story is about a shepherd's son who just lost his father. 
All he has now is his sheep and the sword that in the past belonged to his grandfather. 
But it's not the end of the series of unfortunate events. One day somebody kidnaps the sheep 
and the young man needs to start the most dangerous journey in his life.

### How to play?
After launching the game, you should see **main menu** with five buttons.
Clicking first button causes **starting new game** while second one lets you **choose the specific level** 
you are interested in. Third button is responsible for options - you can **change the volume** of main music, 
sound effects or dialogs. Fourth button leads to the About Section in which you can **read about the plot** 
of the game and get to know the names of game creators. Last button simply **turns off the application**.

</p>

While playing you'll see some **UI elements**. In the left upper corner there will be **player's health bar** 
which you must observe very often because you'll die if it drops to zero. If you are in fight there will be 
also **current enemy's health bar** in the right upper corner. What is more, at the bottom of the screen there 
will be some **story dialogs and tutorial dialogs** (in first level) which will help you in getting to know how to move, fight, etc.

</p>

Depending on the platform you use, **to move**, you have to use WSAD buttons, arrow buttons or built-in joystick. 
**To jump**, you have to use UP/W button or built-in JUMP button. **To attack**, press SPACE button or built-in ATTACK 
button. You can do it on the ground, in the air or while crouching. If you are in the game and press ESCAPE button 
or built-in PAUSE GAME button, whole movement will freeze and you'll see the **pause menu**. There you can change 
the volume, return to the main menu or exit the game.

</p>

As you already know there are a lot of opportunities in which **you can die** (being killed by a monster, 
falling down from the map, hard landing on the ground). Fortunately, there are also a lot of **checkpoints** 
in all of the levels so you can repeat just a part of it, not the whole one). If you die, you'll see **gameover screen**.
There you can restart the game from the checkpoint or return to the main menu.
